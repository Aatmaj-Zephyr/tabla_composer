# tabla_composer

_______

This project aims at machine-generated tabla (ie Indian drums) music. The project is underway.


This project uses Probabilistic Finite State Machines for composing music. The composed notes are then played using recorded tabla beat sounds.
More documentation and examples of this project are underway. If you are interested in this, please contact me on Gmail.
